# Calculator

A calculator Andoird app that mimic that of the Iphone calculator in vertical mode, allowing for basic arithmetic calculations

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Users sees a user-friendly interface with numbers, arithmetic operations, and others
* [x] Users can input numbers with the number buttons
* [x] Users can input decimal numbers with the decimal button
* [x] Users can perform arithmetic operations with the +, -, X, and / buttons
* [x] Users can calculate percentages with the % button
* [x] Users can change from positive to negative and vice versa using the +/- button
* [x] Users can clear the current input and its history with the C button
* [x] Users can see their performed number and/or calculation in the top right hand side (text view)

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* Users see a rounded square button instead of a circular button as the example in the file showed us so
* Users see a properly formatted result with scientific notations if necessary
* Like in Iphone, users can perform multiple sequential calculations without needing to press the equal button each time

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Creating the rounded square was new so I had to search up how to do that
* I had to create buttons for each button, Im not sure if there was a better way to do it as it is still new to me, but that took some time
* The set up code was also a bit difficult to me as I am not used to Kotlin syntax
* Making the 0 appear after each clear but not appending it to the number after it is typed again (e.g. 06) was a bit confusing at the start
